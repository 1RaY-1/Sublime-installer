# Sublime-installer

This bash script installs the latest Sublime Text version.

It is for those people who are tired of installing Sublime Text on their Linux machines by copying and pasting commands in terminal all the time, or for those people who just want to save their time.

This script contains shell commands from Sublime Text [official web site](https://www.sublimetext.com/), from [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/linux_repositories.html).

And it installs the Stable Build (Not Dev)

This script should work on **almost all** Linux distributions.

# Note
***Sometimes the commands to install Sublime Text can be changed by the Devs, so at some point my script will become outdated.*** 

***And scince I don't monitor the commands (from the official site) that often, I would recommend first checking them, and after that only running my scripts.***

***I will eventually check and if needed, edit (update) my scripts.***

***My scripts just contain this official commands, plus a bunch of if's, functions and a switch case to make it all function correctly***

```
git clone https://github.com/IDE-installers/sublime-linux-installer
