# Sublime-installer
Sublime Text installer for Linux written in Bash

This simple bash script is for those people who are tired of installing Sublime Text on their Linux machines by copying and pasting commands in terminal all the time.

Those commands are already pasted in this script from the official web site, so it does all this, but when you execute the script you have to choose which package manager you are using and and which channel to use (Stable or Dev).

This script might work on all Linux distributions.
